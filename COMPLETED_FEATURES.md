# ✅ Completed: Sample Documents Feature

## What Was Built

### 1. Sample Document Generation System

**Generated 8 Professional Documents** (650-750 words each):
- ✅ general_article.txt - Remote work evolution (3.8KB)
- ✅ technical_api_doc.txt - API documentation (6.9KB)  
- ✅ business_report.txt - Quarterly report (4.9KB)
- ✅ creative_brief.txt - Marketing campaign (6.1KB)
- ✅ data_analysis.txt - Customer behavior (6.0KB)
- ✅ tutorial_content.txt - Git tutorial (7.0KB)
- ✅ complex_scenario.txt - Business dilemma (5.3KB)
- ✅ policy_document.txt - Remote work policy (4.4KB)

**Total**: ~6,200 words of clean, professional content

### 2. AI Generation Details

**Model Used**: `gemini-flash-lite-latest` (as requested)

**Prompt Strategy**:
- Very specific prompts with exact word counts
- Detailed section breakdowns with word targets
- Clear style and tone instructions
- No creative freedom - AI follows exact specifications
- Raw strings to avoid escape character issues

**Quality Control**:
- Professional, clean formatting
- Realistic business content with specific numbers
- Varied document types (articles, reports, docs, policies)
- Appropriate complexity for prompt engineering lessons

### 3. Frontend Updates

**New Upload Interface**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [📄 Use Sample Document]       │  ← Primary (highlighted)
│                                 │
│           OR                     │
│                                 │
│  [📤 Upload Your Own]           │  ← Secondary
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**View Full Document Feature**:
- Preview shows first 500 characters
- "View Full Document" button opens modal
- Users can read complete text before writing prompts
- Clean modal with scrollable content

**User Flow**:
1. Lesson starts → AI tutor explains concept
2. **Sample button highlighted** (preferred path)
3. Click → Document loads instantly
4. View preview or full document
5. Write prompt based on document
6. Generate summary with streaming

### 4. Backend Implementation

**New API Endpoint**: `/api/sample/load`
- Takes: session_id, module_id, submodule_id
- Returns: filename, preview, full_content
- Stores in session (same as uploaded docs)

**Document Mapping**: `document_mapping.json`
- Maps each lesson to appropriate document
- Some documents reused across lessons
- Easy to update or change mappings

**Integration**:
- Works seamlessly with existing upload flow
- Same session management
- Same summarization pipeline
- No breaking changes

### 5. CSS Theme Updates (Fixed)

**Applied Old Design Theme**:
- ✅ Light backgrounds (white/light gray)
- ✅ Black primary color
- ✅ Red highlights (#ff3333) for AI guidance
- ✅ Orbitron + Roboto Mono fonts
- ✅ Clean cyber background pattern
- ✅ Enhanced glow effects for highlighting
- ✅ No gradients (as requested)

**New Components**:
- `.upload-options` - Two-button layout
- `.divider-text` - OR separator with lines
- `.secondary-button` - Outline style for upload
- `.view-full-btn` - Inline button styling

### 6. Upload Fix

**Fixed Form Data Issue**:
```python
# Before (caused NameError)
from fastapi import Form
session_id: str = Form(...)

# After (works correctly)
from fastapi import Form as FastAPIForm  
session_id: str = FastAPIForm(...)
```

**Result**: Upload now works for both sample and custom documents

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Quick Test

```bash
# Server should be running at http://localhost:8000
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 2. Full Workflow Test

1. Go to http://localhost:8000
2. Click "Foundations of Prompting" → "01: Focused Summarization"
3. AI tutor welcomes you and highlights "Use Sample Document"
4. Click "Use Sample Document"
5. Document loads (general_article.txt - about remote work)
6. Click "View Full Document" to read complete text
7. Close modal, write a prompt in the text box
8. Click "Generate" - summary streams in
9. AI tutor provides feedback on your prompt quality

### 3. Verify All Documents

```bash
ls -lh frontend/static/samples/
# Should show 8 .txt files + 1 .json mapping file
```
