## üö® Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

1. **No Real Upload**: File input doesn't actually upload - sample doc is hardcoded
2. **No Persistence**: Refresh loses progress (no database)
3. **Gemini API**: Chat Q&A requires API key setup
4. **Submodules 2-4**: Not implemented yet (by design)
5. **No Authentication**: No user accounts

These are intentional for the MVP/demo.

---

## üéØ Testing Tips

1. **Test twice**: Once with bad prompt first, once with good prompt first
2. **Type slowly**: To trigger proactive suggestion
3. **Try different prompts**: Test the constraint detection logic
4. **Check all clicks**: Every button should do something
5. **Read console**: Catch any hidden errors

**Happy Testing!** üß™

If you find issues, check:
1. `academy.js` line numbers in error message
2. Browser compatibility (Chrome/Edge recommended)
