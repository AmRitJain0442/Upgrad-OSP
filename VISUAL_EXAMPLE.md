### 📥 What Gemini Returns (Raw)
```
**Data-Ink Ratio Principle**, which advocates for maximizing the ink or pixels that present data and minimizing non-data elements. To achieve this, designers should eliminate unnecessary decorations like 3D diagrams, grid lines, and color gradients. In visual design, the **top-left and center areas** receive the most attention, so critical information should be placed there, while non-essentials like logos should be avoided. To emphasize important data, designers can use visual attributes such as **saturated colors, larger sizes, and thicker lines**.

### Questions and Answers (Based only on the provided text)

**What is Edward Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio Principle?**
It is a principle that states you should maximize the data-ink ratio, meaning every pixel of ink on a graphic should present new information.

**What are some examples of non-value adding elements?**
The document lists 3D diagrams, grid lines in bar graphs, unnecessary decoration, color gradients, and irrelevant backgrounds.

**What three visual attributes can be used to make elements seem more important?**
1. **Color Intensity:** Saturated colors are perceived as more important.
2. **Size:** Larger elements are perceived as more important.
3. **Line Width:** Thicker lines stand out more.
